int getParity(int n) 
{ 
    int parity = 0; 
    while (n) 
    { 
        parity = !parity; 
        n     = n & (n - 1);

}

The property is, the difference between a binary number n and n-1 is all the bits on the right of the rightmost 1 are flipped including the rightmost 1. Using this amazing property, we can get our solution as

x ^ (x & (x - 1))
